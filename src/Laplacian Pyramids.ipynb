      "In this introductory post, we\u2019ll write code to construct and collapse Laplacian pyramids \u2014 a method of expanding an image in a redundant way that is often useful for downstream image processing. In the next post, we\u2019ll make use of a Laplacian pyramid to perform a type of edge-aware image processing, known as local Laplacian filtering. Edge aware processing methods are useful, and in many cases, necessary, for applications such as denoising, where retaining edge sharpness is important, and local contrast adjustment, where avoiding halos is desirable.\n",
